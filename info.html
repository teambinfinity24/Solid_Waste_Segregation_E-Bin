    <h2>Information of Different Waste Materials</h2>

        <h2>Plastic Waste</h2>
        <p>Plastic bottles are commonly used for packaging beverages, toiletries, and household products due to their lightweight, durability, and convenience. Made primarily from materials like PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate), they are designed to be strong and resistant to breakage. However, the widespread use of plastic bottles has led to significant environmental issues, as many end up in landfills or oceans, contributing to pollution and harming wildlife. While they are recyclable, only a fraction is properly recycled, highlighting the need for better waste management practices. Efforts to reduce the impact of plastic bottles include promoting reusable alternatives, enhancing recycling systems, and increasing public awareness about responsible disposal.</p>

        <h2>Tin Waste</h2>
        <p>Tin cans, widely used for beverages like Coke, Sprite, and many other soft drinks, are primarily made from aluminum or tin-plated steel. These cans are popular because they are lightweight, durable, and provide excellent protection against light and air, preserving the flavor and carbonation of the drinks. Additionally, they are convenient for transportation and storage. One of the key advantages of these cans is their recyclability; aluminum cans, in particular, can be recycled indefinitely without losing quality, making them a more sustainable option compared to plastic bottles. However, improper disposal still contributes to environmental pollution. To reduce their impact, it is essential to promote recycling, encourage the use of reusable alternatives, and raise awareness about responsible waste management.</p>

        <h2>Paper Cups</h2>
        <p>Paper cups are widely used for serving hot and cold beverages due to their convenience, lightweight design, and disposable nature. They are typically made from paper coated with a thin layer of plastic or wax to prevent leakage and maintain the drink's temperature. Although they are perceived as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic cups, most paper cups are not easily recyclable because of the plastic lining, which requires specialized recycling facilities. As a result, many end up in landfills, contributing to environmental pollution. To minimize their impact, it is crucial to promote the use of biodegradable or compostable cups, encourage recycling programs, and adopt reusable alternatives like metal or ceramic cups.</p>

        <h2>Other Waste</h2>
        <p>Other wastes refer to a variety of materials that do not fall under specific categories like plastic, metal, or paper. These include organic waste (food scraps and yard trimmings), electronic waste (old gadgets and appliances), textiles (clothing and fabrics), and hazardous waste (batteries, chemicals, and medical waste). Proper disposal and management of these wastes are crucial to prevent environmental pollution and health hazards. For example, organic waste can be composted to create nutrient-rich soil, while electronic waste requires special recycling processes to recover valuable materials and prevent toxic substances from harming the environment. Promoting waste segregation, recycling, and sustainable consumption practices are essential steps toward effective waste management and environmental conservation..</p>
